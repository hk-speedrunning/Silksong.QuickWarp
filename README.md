# Quickwarp

A basic warp-to-scene menu for Silksong, created for use alongside [DebugMod](<https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/Silksong.DebugMod>).

Usage: Press F5, select a map area, then scene, then transition. You may need to pause to make the menu interactable with the mouse.

Config: Open `<game files>/BepInEx/config/io.github.hk-speedrunning.quickwarp.cfg` and change the `Toggle Quickwarp Menu` setting.

Installation: See the [Latest Release](<https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/Silksong.QuickWarp/releases/latest>).
